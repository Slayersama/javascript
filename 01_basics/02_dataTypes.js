/* 
 Data Types In JavaScript
    1. numbers => it has a range of 2 to the power of 53
    2. bigInt => used to store numbers larger numbers
    3. string => always use "" instead of ''. stores alphabetic values
    4. boolean => contains true or false values. 
    5. null => stand alone value.
    6. undefined => value is not defined yet. It's not same as null both are different. We prefer this if we want to reserve variable but not the data type for future use.
    7. symbol => unique values
